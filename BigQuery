## Bicycle Data Practice

## Table and Column Selection
SELECT 
   end_station_name 
FROM 
   `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`;
   
   
## Number of Trips Query
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS num_of_trips 
FROM 
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
WHERE 
    duration >= 1200;


## Station Query
SELECT
     end_station_name
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
WHERE
     rental_id = 57635395;


## Distinct Query
SELECT
     DISTINCT rental_id
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`

## Query for String Length
SELECT
     LENGTH(end_station_name) AS end_station_length
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
    
    
## Query for Station Length Name <10 Characters
SELECT
     end_station_name
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
WHERE
    LENGTH(end_station_name) <10
    
    
## Query to Substring
SELECT
     DISTINCT rental_id
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
WHERE
    SUBSTR(end_station_name, 1, 3) = 'LSP'
    

## Trim Function for Spaces
SELECT
     DISTINCT rental_id
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
WHERE
    TRIM(end_station_name) = 'LSP2'


## Sort Data 
SELECT
     duration
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
ORDER BY
    duration DESC


## Typecasting Data
SELECT
     CAST(duration AS FLOAT64)
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
ORDER BY
    CAST(duration AS FLOAT64) DESC
    
    
## Combining String Values
SELECT
     usertype,
     CONCAT(start_station_name "to" end_station_name) AS route,
     COUNT(*) AS num_trips,
     ROUND(AVG(CAST(tripduration as INT64) / 60) / 2 AS duration
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips` 
GROUP BY
    start_station_name,
    end_station_name,
    user_type
ORDER BY
    num_trips DESC
LIMIT 10


## Count Distinct and Inner Join
SELECT
     new_york.citi_blocks AS blocks
     COUNT(DISTINCT new_york.citibike_trips) AS num_trips
FROM
     new_york.citibike_trips AS city_bike 
INNERJOIN
     new_york.citiwalking_trips AS city_walk ON city_bike.person_id = city_walk.person_id
GROUP BY
     new_york.citi_blocks
