WHERE 
    duration >= 1200;


## Station Query
SELECT
     end_station_name
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
WHERE
     rental_id = 57635395;


## Distinct Query
SELECT
     DISTINCT rental_id
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`

## Query for String Length
SELECT
     LENGTH(end_station_name) AS end_station_length
FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire` 
    
    
## Query for Station Length Name <10 Characters
